<p>Fun fact: the NESBox page on this site (labeled "classic games emulator") didn't work for users of the site, as it was shared
locally. Users downloaded as a zip file from Google Drive, and unzipped it to play.
NESBox only works when it's hosted online for whatever reason, so  here
my years-old code finally gets the chance to work.</p>
