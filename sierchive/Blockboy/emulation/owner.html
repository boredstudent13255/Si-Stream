<h1>This is the webpage where info about the owner/creator of this gaming site is found.</h1>
<p>you might have misclicked, but if not, thanks! glad to know some players here care.</p>
<p>I am just your average minecraft player, kind of in-between being a noob and a tryhard in most cases. I used to have a Minecraft youtube channel, but I don't upload anymore (except to report hackers)</p>
<p>I have a small Bedrock minecraft server, if you're intrested. just put the same URL you used to get here in the IP slot when you go to add the server. Port is the same, and the name is Purest Vanilla.</p>
<p>I don't have many regulars, so check it out.</p>
<p>if you mention this website in a chat and i'm in the right mood, I might give you OP, granted i'm online and I think you're trustworthy. either way, this server is running the Realms based Dedicated Server software, so it's almost exactly like playing on a local world with friends, except it's a public world.</p>
